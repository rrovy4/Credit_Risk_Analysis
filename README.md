# Overview

Using various ML models, the goal is to predict credit risks for the available data. Following ML models were used against the data:
- Oversampling (Native Random and SMOTE)
- Undersampling
- Combination of Oversampling and Undersampling
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

# Results
- For Oversampling, the balanced accuracy score observed was 66%
- For SMOTE Oversampling, the accuracy score observed was 65%
- For Undersampling, the accuracy score observed was 52%
- For the combination of Oversampling and Undersampling, the accuracy score was not displayed due to error!
- For Balanced Random Forest Classifier the score was 78%
- For Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier was 93%

# Summary
Out of all the ML models implemented, it is observed that the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier is the one with highest accuracy
